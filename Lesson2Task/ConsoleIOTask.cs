/*
* TASK:
* Create a program that fills out a mad lib with data supplied by the user.
* (Hint: a Verb is an action. A noun is a person/place/thing.
* An adjective describes a person/place/thing.)
* 
* NOTE: Be sure that you have proper spaceing between words.
* 
* Example Output:
*   Enter Occupation(a job): Gardener
*   Enter Noun1: Bird
*   Enter Adjective1: Blue
*   Enter Noun2: Hat
*   Enter Verb1: Fight
*   Enter Adjective2: Happy
*   Enter Noun3: Boots
*   Enter Verb2: Run
*   Enter Noun4: Gloves
*   Enter Verb3: Fall
*   
*   Today a <Occupation> named <Noun4> came to our school to talk to us about her job.
*   She said the most important skill you need to know to do her job is to be able
*   to <Verb2> around (a) <Adjective1> <Noun3>.
*   She said it was easy for her to learn her job because she loved to <Verb1> when she was my age--
*   and that helps a lot! If you're considering her profession,
*   I hope you can be near (a) <Adjective2> <Noun1>. That's very important!
*   If you get too distracted in that situation you won't be able to <Verb3> next to (a) <Noun2>!
*
