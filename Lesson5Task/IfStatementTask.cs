/*
* TASK:
*   Use console commands to ask the user a question, take their input,
*   then give feedback if the user is right or wrong.
*   
*   TIME TO THINK:
*     COUNT every CORRECT answer the user gives and tell them the number of correct answers at the end of the program.
*   
*   Make 6 questions. 
*   Make a question that uses one of the following comparison opperators to check for the correct answer.
*   Each comparison opperator must be used at least once.
*   
*   ==
*   !=
*   >
*   <
*   >=
*   <=
*   
*   If it is hard to think of a question. You can ask things like "What number is greater than 8" >
*   OR "What number is less than or equal to 8.3" <=
*   OR "Do not type Ball" !=
* 
* Example Output:
*   bla bla?
*   yes
*   bla bla?
*   no
*   bla bla?
*   3
*   bla bla?
*   ball
*   bla bla?
*   9.8
*   bla bla?
*   2
*   
*   You got 4 questions right!
*   
* BONUS POINTS:
*   Also display the number of questions they got wrong
