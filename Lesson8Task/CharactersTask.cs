/*
* TASK:
*   Make a for loop that starts at 97 and goes to 122 (includes 122).
*   Convert the integer you use for the for loop into a char and print it. 
*   It will print a lowercase letter.
*   Then print the same letter but in uppercase in the same loop.
*   
*   You can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters as a reference.
